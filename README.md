# 42-journey

My journey going through 42 SCHOOL assignments without actually attending the school. Life gets in the way and I'd like to do it at my pace.

  Piscine finished! 
  Yeah. A bit late on my schedule. Took some breaks here and there, but started taking it seriously at the end of 2024. I went through all of the modules, I think the only problem I ended up skipping was the n-queens problem. Towards the end I let myself be more free with norminette checks.
